# Welcome to Boredom (skip) App!

This project is part of a technical test.

## Features Status

### Login

✅ When the app starts, the user is taken to a public route called /login.

✅ The user must introduce a name before being able to enter the App.

✅ The name must be validated. Let it only introduce alphabetic characters.

✅ This name must be persisted in a way that can be used later on. If the user reloads the application it can pass directly to the dashboard.

- Dashboard: Table
 
✅ Shows 10 random activities

✅ Ability to search by name

✅ Ability to order by column

✅ Button for retrieving new data from API (refresh)

✅ Add multiple activities to favorites at the same time

✅ Ask for more than 10 random activities and show a pagination to navigate between them (max 10 activities per page)

- Side Panel
✅ Show a list of favourited activities and their information.
✅ Let the user remove a favourite activiti from the list
✅ Can you make these favourite activities persist between reloads?

- Dropdown
✅ Program a dropdown that lets you log out and open the Side Pane with your favorites list.

- Modal
✅ No mockups provided for this task. Create a call to action wherever in the dashboard you think
suits best. This CTA should open an overlay modal over the dashboard and will provide the user
with one random activity to do and its details.
